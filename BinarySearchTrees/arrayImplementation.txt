To implement a binary search tree using an array in Python, you will need to use the following steps:

Define a class for the binary search tree, which will store the elements in an array. The class should include methods for inserting, searching, and traversing the tree.

Initialize the array with a null value at the root index (index 0). This will represent the root node of the tree.

To insert a new element into the tree, first compare it to the value at the root node. If the new element is less than the value at the root node, insert it into the left subtree by setting the left child index (2i + 1) to the new element. If the new element is greater than the value at the root node, insert it into the right subtree by setting the right child index (2i + 2) to the new element.

To search for an element in the tree, first compare it to the value at the root node. If the element is less than the value at the root node, search the left subtree by recursively calling the search method with the left child index as the new root. If the element is greater than the value at the root node, search the right subtree by recursively calling the search method with the right child index as the new root.

To traverse the tree, first visit the left subtree by recursively calling the traverse method with the left child index as the new root. Then, visit the root node. Finally, visit the right subtree by recursively calling the traverse method with the right child index as the new root.

Here is an example implementation of a binary search tree using an array in Python:

class BinarySearchTree:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.tree = [None] * capacity
    
    def insert(self, element, i=0):
        if self.tree[i] is None:
            self.tree[i] = element
        elif element < self.tree[i]:
            self.insert(element, 2*i + 1)
        elif element > self.tree[i]:
            self.insert(element, 2*i + 2)
    
    def search(self, element, i=0):
        if self.tree[i] is None:
            return False
        elif element == self.tree[i]:
            return True
        elif element < self.tree[i]:
            return self.search(element, 2*i + 1)
        elif element > self.tree[i]:
            return self.search(element, 2*i + 2)
    
    def traverse(self, i=0):
        if self.tree[i] is not None:
            self.traverse(2*i + 1)
            print(self.tree[i])
            self.traverse(2*i + 2)

tree = BinarySearchTree(10)
tree.insert(5)
tree.insert(3)
tree.insert(7)
tree.insert(1)
tree.insert(4)
tree.insert(6)
tree.insert(8)
tree.traverse()
print(tree.search(7))
This code will create a binary search tree with a capacity of 10, insert the elements 5, 3, 7, 1, 4, 6, and 8 into the tree.
